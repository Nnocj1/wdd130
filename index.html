            <p>Hello, My name is Nicholas Oblitey Commey. A Software Development Major Student from Ghana, Accra. I enjoy singing, playing the organ, innovation design and computer programming. I'm much excited by my studies and look forward to working as a frontend-developer or Software Quality Assurance Tester for a company. So far I have experience writing programs using HTML, CSS, SQL and Python. I am also a fast learner and I hope to quickly develop more skills. If you think I can be of help to you, please reach out to me. I will be glad to help as much as possible.</p>
